    Build your own indexation classes



.. rubric:: :subtitle:`Importation`

The indexation module can be easily imported from the actuarial package:

.. code-block:: python

    from actuarial import indexation



.. rubric:: :subtitle:`Content`

Several classes are implemented in this module:

    |1| Abstract indexation class

    |2| Various indexation models
   
First, we can find an **abstract class** called `Indexation`.
This abstract class allows building indexation models in a standardized way and with various pre-implemented features.
Therefore, all indexation models implemented in this package inherit from this abstract class.
Moreover, it also allows you to build and customize your own indexation models (by inheriting from this abstract class).
Related documentation can be found here: :ref:`indexation.Indexation`.

Secondly, the module offers different **indexation models**.
It implements the flat indexation model (constant inflation over time) and the indexation based on a price index (inflation changing over time).
All these models inherit from the `Indexation` abstract class as described above.
In this way, they all share a common set of features (properties and methods) and they can be easily identified as an indexation
(using Python's built-in functions `isinstance` or `issubclass`).
The following indexation models are implemented in this module (in alphabetical order):
