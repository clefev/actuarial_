.. rubric:: :subtitle:`Importation`

The copula module can be easily imported from the actuarial package:

.. code-block:: python

    from actuarial import copula



.. rubric:: :subtitle:`Content`

Several classes are implemented in this module:

    |1| Abstract copula class

    |2| Various copula models

First, we can find an **abstract class** called `Copula`.
This abstract class allows building copula models in a standardized way and with various pre-implemented features.
Therefore, all copula models implemented in this package inherit from this abstract class.
Moreover, it also allows you to build and customize your own copula models (by inheriting from this abstract class).
Related documentation can be found here: :ref:`copula.Copula`.

Secondly, the module offers different **copula models**.
For example, it implements the Gaussian copula, the comonotonic copula, the Clayton copula, ...
All these models inherit from the `Copula` abstract class as described above.
In this way, they all share a common set of features (properties and methods) and they can be easily identified as a copula
(using Python's built-in functions `isinstance` or `issubclass`).
The following copula models are implemented in this module (in alphabetical order):
